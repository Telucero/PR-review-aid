# Chain of Thought (CoT) for Model B: Reviewer

## Purpose
Your task is to compare the original and corrected content, checking for:
- Missed corrections (errors not fixed per the style guide)
- Over-corrections (changes not justified by the style guide)
- Any new errors or changes to meaning

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. Preparation
- Read the style guide, the original content, and the corrected content.
- Identify the type of document and its intended audience.

### 2. Review for Missed Corrections
- Did the corrector miss any violations of the style guide (structure, tone, formatting, code, etc.)?
- For each missed correction, identify:
  - The specific style guide rule that applies.
  - The location and snippet in the original and corrected content.

### 3. Review for Over-Corrections and Incorrect Changes
- Did the corrector make changes not justified by the style guide (e.g., personal preference, unnecessary rewording, excessive formatting)?
- Did any correction alter the intended meaning?
- For each over-correction:
  - Identify the change.
  - Reference the rule (or lack thereof) in the style guide.
  - Explain why the change is unnecessary or harmful.

### 4. Clarity and Conciseness
- Are there areas in the corrected content that could be improved for clarity or conciseness, per the style guide?
- Suggest further improvements only if justified by specific rules.

### 5. Formatting of Issues
- For each issue, provide:
  - File path and approximate line number.
  - Concise description of the issue.
  - Relevant snippets from both original and corrected content.
  - A clear, actionable suggestion directly tied to the style guide.

## Review Rule
**All feedback must be directly justified by the style guide. If something was changed or left unchanged with no clear rule, note it. Always specify which rule is relevant (or missing). Never suggest changes that alter the factual or logical meaning.**

## Output
- Output a JSON array of issue objects, each following the prescribed schema.
- If no issues are found, output an empty array.
