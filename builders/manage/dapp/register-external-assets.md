# Register External Assets

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Cross-chain asset transfer is crucial because it enables the seamless movement of digital assets across different networks, enhancing interoperability, liquidity, and user experience. To enable asset transfers to and from two networks, first, a bidirectional channel must be open between them. Thanks to the Tanssi dApp, opening a channel is an easy and quick task. Please refer to the [Manage Cross-Chain Communication Channels](/builders/manage/dapp/xcm-channels/){target=\_blank} article to know how to do it.

!!! note
    Opening a bidirectional communication channel requires approval from both networks governors.

Once your network's communication channels are established, you can register other chain's assets (external assets) to start operating. This guide will walk you through the process of registering external assets using the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

- A Tanssi-powered network (Dedicated) running [runtime 500](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/tag/runtime-500){target=\_blank} or above

## Accessing the External Assets Registration Panel {: #accesing-external-assets-management-panel }

--8<-- 'text/builders/manage/dapp/cross-chain-config-panel.md'

The panel will show your network's cross-chain configuration along with several available actions. Regarding external assets, the relevant elements you are presented with are:

1. **Registered Assets panel** - this section will group and present to you all registered assets your network already has available
2. **Registered Assets List** - already registered external assets will be displayed in this section, along with their associated information such as asset name, symbol, ID, total supply, and network ID where it is native
3. **Asset Registration** - this option allows you to select other available external assets and register them. The [following section](#register-external-asset) explains how to do it

## Register an External Asset {: #register-external-asset }

Provided your network has already established bidirectional communicaction channels with another network, the network governor can register external assets.

To do so, click on **Asset Registration** and then:

1. Select at least one of the available assets from the list
2. Click on **Register**

You'll be asked to sign the transaction, and once it's gone through, the external asset will be available locally.

!!! note
    The dApp only presents well-known assets from well-known networks of the ecosystem. If the asset you need to register is not listed, you'll have to do it using the developer portal.
