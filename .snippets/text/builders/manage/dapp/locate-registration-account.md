If you're unsure what your registration account is, you can query it directly from the Tanssi orchestrator chain, which keeps records of every registered network. To do so, head to the **Chain state** section on the Polkadot.js Apps connected to the orchestrator chain for [quick trial networks](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://fraa-flashbox-rpc.a.stagenet.tanssi.network#/chainstate){target=\_blank} or [dedicated networks](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://dancelight.tanssi-api.network#/chainstate){target=\_blank}, and take the following steps:

1. Select the **registrar** storage module
2. Select **registrarDeposit**
3. Insert your network ID
4. Press **+** icon

You'll see the registration account at the bottom.

    The dApp will show your network in the dashboard only if you have the registration account properly set.
