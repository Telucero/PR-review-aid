One of Tanssi's core propositions for builders is that it provides Ethereum-grade economic security to every Tanssi-powered network, regardless of its TVL, userbase, or the specifics of the use case. Tanssi's design offers developers a shared security model, alleviating them from having to source enough economic security or negotiate with operators to run nodes opting in for their networks. 

The protocol achieves this by integrating with [external security providers](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank}, such as [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}. In this model, different [vaults](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/#vaults){target=\_blank} associated with Tanssi provide economic security, and reliable operators can be allowed to provide their validation services to both, the vault and the Tanssi network.

In every session, the Tanssi protocol determines how many validators are required to support the entire ecosystem. With the number of validators, the protocol picks those with the higher delegated stake from the allow-listed ones.
