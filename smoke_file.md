Native Token Transfers Overview＃
Native Token Transfers (NTT) provides an adaptable framework for transferring your native tokens across different blockchains. Unlike traditional wrapped assets, NTT maintains your token's native properties on every chain. This ensures that you retain complete control over crucial aspects, such as metadata, ownership, upgradeability, and custom features.

Key Features＃
Control and customization: Ensure ownership and configurable access controls, permissions, and thresholds, preventing unauthorized calls.
Advanced rate limiting: Set rate limits per chain and period to prevent abuse, manage network congestion, and control deployments.
Global accountant: Ensures the amount burned and transferred on chains never exceeds the amount of tokens minted.
No wrapped tokens: Tokens are used directly within their native ecosystem, eliminating intermediary transfer steps.
