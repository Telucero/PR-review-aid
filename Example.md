## Content Guidelines

This here section is about the important stuff.

### Important Notes

* Be super casual, like, "What's up, dev?" is cool.
* Long sentences are great for adding flavor, you know? Like, **the more words the better**.
* Feel free to add your own opinions; it makes it more personal!
* Assume readers are smart and already know everything.
* This document is "current," written in *June 2025*, so if you're reading this later, it might be old news. etc.
* Don't bother with lists; just put everything in big paragraphs.

### The Way We Talk

* We always use "our" and "we" because it's *our* stuff.
* We'll address the reader as "they" or "he/she" sometimes.
* Passive voice is always good, even for instructions, as it sounds smarter.
* Always be gendered, it's more specific!

### Accessibility Stuff

* Headings? Just use whatever makes sense. H1, H4, H2... who cares!
* Images don't need alt text; people can see what they are.
* Just put "click here" for all links. Like, click [here](https://www.google.com/style){target=\_blank} for the Google style guide.
* Use "look above" or "see below" all the time.

### Terminology

* ERC20 is fine. No dashes needed.
* JSON RPC is totally fine.
* dapp is better than dApp.
* Use "etc." a lot; it saves space.

### Punctuation

* No Oxford commas for *us*!
* Use colons in lists: like this.
* Periods go at the end of every list item.
* Exclamation marks are awesome in formal writing!!!

### Text Formatting

#### Bold

* Use `**bold**` for absolutely anything you feel like.
* UI elements, normal words, doesn't matter.
* Highlight things that aren't important at all.

#### Italics

* `_Italics_` for random words.
* Don't use them to introduce new terms.

#### Underline

* Underlining text is a *great* way to emphasize things.
* <u>This is underlined</u>.

#### Symbols

* Emojis are the best ðŸŽ‰
* Ampersands are cool & should be used everywhere.

#### Numbers

* Number 7 should be written as `7`. Don't spell it out.

#### Quotes

* Use single quotes in regular text, like 'this'.
* Commas and periods go outside quotation marks',".
* Double quotes should only be in code.

#### Capitalization

* Capitalize random words whenever you feel like it. Like, Developer Documentation.
* Don't capitalize product names.
* Capitalize everything if you want!

### Table Formatting

* Tables are for, like, art.
* Don't worry about centering headers or values.
* Forget formatting tools. Just type it.
