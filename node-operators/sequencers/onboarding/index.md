# Onboarding

Your journey as a sequencer begins here. This section covers the foundational steps to set up your node and prepare your account for active participation in the Tanssi network.

Use the following resources to get started as a sequencer:

- [**Hardware requirements**](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/#hardware-requirements) - understand the recommended hardware specifications to ensure optimal performance of your sequencer node
- [**Port configuration**](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/#required-network-ports) - learn which network ports need to be open to facilitate proper communication within the Tanssi ecosystem
- **Session keys setup** - detailed instructions on [generating](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/account-setup/#map-account) and [managing](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/account-setup/#map-session-keys) session keys, a vital step for enabling block production capabilities
- **Node deployment** - choose between [Docker](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/sequencers-docker/) and [systemd](/node-operators/sequencers/onboarding/run-a-sequencer/sequencers-systemd/) for running your node, with step-by-step guides tailored for each method
