# Node Operators

Operating nodes is a crucial part of maintaining a blockchain ecosystem, and Tanssi ensures that this process is as seamless as possible. From running network nodes and managing sequencers to onboarding validators, this section provides everything you need to get started and operate efficiently.

Whether you're setting up for the first time, handling operational tasks, or retiring your node, these guides offer clear and concise instructions to help you maintain secure and reliable operations.

### Node Types in the Tanssi Ecosystem

Understanding the roles of different nodes in the Tanssi-powered network helps you choose the right one based on your desired level of participation in the Tanssi ecosystem:

- [**Network nodes**](/node-operators/network-node/) - provide RPC endpoints and data availability services for smooth data flow and interaction between chains and users
- [**Sequencers**](/node-operators/sequencers/) - responsible for block production, transaction execution, and network maintenance to ensure liveness and operational continuity
- [**Validators**](/node-operators/validators/) - also known as network operators, validators are responsible for verifying that transactions executed on Tanssi-powered networks are valid according to their state transition function. They also produce blocks for the Tanssi network itself
