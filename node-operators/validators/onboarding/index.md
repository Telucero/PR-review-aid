# Onboarding

Your journey as a validator begins here. This section covers the foundational steps to set up your node and prepare your account for active participation in the Tanssi network.

Use the following resources to get started as a validator:

- [**Hardware requirements**](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/run-a-validator/#hardware-requirements) - understand the recommended hardware specifications to ensure optimal performance of your sequencer node
- [**Port configuration**](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/run-a-validator/#required-network-ports) - learn which network ports need to be open to ensure proper communication within the Tanssi ecosystem
- [**Register in Symbiotic**](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/register-in-symbiotic) - learn how to register your node in the Symbiotic protocol
- [**Opt in to Tanssi**](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/opt-in-to-tanssi/) - learn how to opt in to the Tanssi network and Tanssi-enabled Symbiotic vaults

!!! note
    The public TestNet is not yet open to registrations by external operators.
