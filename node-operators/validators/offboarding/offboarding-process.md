# Offboarding Process

This guide provides detailed instructions for each step of the validator offboarding process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth transition.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the offboarding process, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the wallet that controls your validator operator account
- Your validator operator address and network address
- Sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees for transactions

### Interaction Methods

To follow this guide, you must interact with smart contracts. There are several ways to interact with the smart contracts:

- Using the [Symbiotic CLI](../../onboarding/opt-in-to-tanssi/#set-up-the-cli)
- Using Etherscan
- Using Safe for multisig setups

In any case, you'll need to sign the transaction using your operator account. You can choose between different options to do so:

- Using a hot wallet, such as MetaMask
- Using a cold wallet, such as Ledger
- Using the account's private key directly (not recommended for security reasons)

The following sections outline the steps for each method of interaction.

## Opt out from the Tanssi Network

The first step in the offboarding process is to opt out of the Tanssi network. This will enable Tanssi to verify your intent to leave the protocol and validate your identity.

!!! important "Identity Validation"
    When opting out, you sign the transaction using the private key or Ledger device associated with your operator account. This signature serves as cryptographic proof that you are the legitimate owner of the operator account, ensuring that only authorized operators can initiate the offboarding process.

### Using the Symbiotic CLI {: #opt-out-network-with-cli }

The Symbiotic CLI provides a straightforward way to opt out from the network. Choose the appropriate command based on your network and signing method:

#### Using a Ledger Device

=== "MainNet"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-network INSERT_NETWORK_ADDRESS --ledger --ledger-account INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-network {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }} --ledger --ledger-account INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS --chain sepolia
    ```

For signing with a private key:

=== "MainNet"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-network INSERT_NETWORK_ADDRESS --private-key INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-network {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }} --private-key INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY --chain sepolia
    ```

!!! warning
    Note that this method requires you to expose your private key; therefore, it is not recommended.

### Using Etherscan {: #opt-out-network-with-etherscan }

You can interact directly with the smart contract through Etherscan using a browser wallet like MetaMask:

=== "MainNet"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.network_registry }}](https://etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.network_registry }}#writeContract){target=\_blank}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.network_registry }}](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.network_registry }}#writeContract){target=\_blank}

Make sure to select **`Contract`** and **`Write Contract`** then click on Connect to Web3, and select your preferred wallet (e.g. MetaMask):
![Connect to Web3 step](/images/node-operators/validators/offboarding/offboarding-process/offboarding-process-1.webp)

1. Expand the **`optOut`** function
2. Insert the `TANSSI_NETWORK_ADDRESS` in the **where** field (e.g, `{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }}` on Sepolia TestNet)
3. Click **Write** and sign the transaction

![Opt out operator](/images/node-operators/validators/offboarding/offboarding-process/offboarding-process-2.webp)

### Using Safe for Multisig Setups {: #opt-out-network-with-safe }

For [Safe](https://app.safe.global/){target=\_blank} accounts, use the Transaction Builder with these addresses:

=== "MainNet"

    {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.network_registry }}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.network_registry }}

Finally, pick the optOut function, insert the `TANSSI_NETWORK_ADDRESS` to which your node is currently registered (e.g, `{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }}` on Sepolia TestNet), and sign the transaction.

### Verify Opt out Status {: #verify-opt-out-status }

After submitting the opt out transaction, you can verify your opt out status using one of these methods:

#### Using Etherscan

You can check your opt out status on Etherscan:

=== "MainNet"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.network_registry }}](https://etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.network_registry }}#readContract){target=\_blank}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.network_registry }}](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.network_registry }}#readContract){target=\_blank}

On the contract's page:

1. Click on the **Read Contract** tab
2. Ensure your wallet is connected; if not, connect it again
3. Select the **`isOptedIn`** function
4. Paste your operator's account in the **who** field
5. Insert the `TANSSI_NETWORK_ADDRESS` in the **where** field (e.g., `{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }}` on Sepolia TestNet)
6. Click on **Query**

You'll get a `false` result if your operator has successfully opted out and `true` if they are still opted in.

#### Using the Symbiotic CLI

You can also verify your opt out status using the Symbiotic CLI:

=== "MainNet"
    
    ```bash
    python3 symb.py check-opt-in-network INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.tanssi_network }}
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py check-opt-in-network INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.tanssi_network }} --chain sepolia
    ```

The output will show `false` if you have successfully opted out and `true` if you are still opted in.

## Contact Tanssi Team

After opting out from the network, notify the Tanssi team of your intention to stop operating as a validator:

1. Complete the [validator offboarding form](INSERT_FORM_URL){target=_blank} with the following information:
    - Your account address
    - Opt out transaction hash (for verification)
    - Preferred timeline for offboarding
    - Reason for offboarding (optional)

2. Wait for confirmation from the Tanssi team acknowledging your request

## Middleware Removal

Once your request is received and processed, the Tanssi team will schedule the removal of your operator from the middleware. This process typically takes two epochs to complete. You will receive a notification when it is complete. This step requires no action, but you must wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next steps.

You will be notified by email when it is safe to decommission the node. Please wait for this notification before proceeding with the next steps.

!!! info "What is an Epoch?"
    A network epoch is when a specific set of operators, determined by their captured stake, operates for the network. The middleware removal process follows a specific timeline:
    - At epoch `n`: Your operator is paused
    - At epoch `n+1`: Your operator is unregistered

    The epoch duration is designed to ensure that withdrawals don't impact the captured stake, taking into account the vault's veto and execution phases. This two-epoch process ensures a smooth transition and proper settlement of all operations.

## Pause Operations

After receiving the confirmation email indicating that your middleware removal is complete, you can safely decommission your validator node.

1. **Stop the Validator Service**: Start by fully stopping your validator service. Ensure the service is no longer running, and all related processes have been terminated. If needed, back up any important configuration files or data.

2. **Clean Up Resources**: Once the node is stopped, you can clean up your resources. This includes safely removing or repurposing the hardware or virtual machine hosting the validator. If you are using cloud infrastructure, it's safe to terminate the associated instances. Itâ€™s also a good idea to back up logs and configuration files in case you need to reference them in the future.

## Vault Opt out (Optional)

After completing the above steps, you may optionally opt out from the vault using one of these methods:

### Using the Symbiotic CLI {: #opt-out-vault-with-cli }

With Ledger:

=== "MainNet"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-vault INSERT_VAULT_ADDRESS --ledger --ledger-account INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-vault {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault }} --ledger --ledger-account INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS --chain sepolia
    ```

With private key:

=== "MainNet"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-vault INSERT_VAULT_ADDRESS --private-key INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py opt-out-vault {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault }} --private-key INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY --chain sepolia
    ```

!!! warning
    Note that this method requires you to expose your private key; therefore, it is not recommended.

### Using Etherscan {: #opt-out-vault-with-etherscan }

Access the contract through Etherscan:

=== "MainNet"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.vault_registry }}](https://etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.vault_registry }}#writeContract){target=\_blank}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault_registry }}](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault_registry }}#writeContract){target=\_blank}

Make sure to select `Contract` and `Write Contract` then click on Connect to Web3, and select your preferred wallet (e.g. MetaMask):
![Connect to Web3 step](/images/node-operators/validators/offboarding/offboarding-process/offboarding-process-4.webp)

1. Expand the **`optOut`** function
2. Insert the `VAULT_ADDRESS` in the **where** field (e.g, `{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault }}` on Sepolia TestNet)
3. Click **Write** and sign the transaction

![Opt out operator](/images/node-operators/validators/offboarding/offboarding-process/offboarding-process-5.webp)

### Using Safe {: #opt-out-vault-with-safe }

For Safe accounts, use these contract addresses in the Transaction Builder:

=== "MainNet"

    {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.vault_registry }}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault_registry }}

Finally, pick the optOut function, insert the `VAULT_ADDRESS` to which your node is currently registered (e.g, `{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault }}` on Sepolia TestNet), and sign the transaction.

### Verify Vault Opt out Status {: #verify-vault-opt-out-status }

After submitting the vault opt-out transaction, you can verify your opt-out status using one of these methods:

#### Using Etherscan

You can check your vault opt out status on Etherscan:

=== "MainNet"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.vault_registry }}](https://etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.mainnet.vault_registry }}#readContract){target=\_blank}

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    [Contract address: {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault_registry }}](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/{{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault_registry }}#readContract){target=\_blank}

On the contract's page:

1. Click on the **Read Contract** tab
2. Ensure your wallet is connected; if not, connect it again
3. Select the **`isOptedIn`** function
4. Paste your operator's account in the **who** field
5. Insert the vault address in the **where** field
6. Click on **Query**

You'll get a `false` result if your operator has successfully opted out of the vault and `true` if they are still opted in.

#### Using the Symbiotic CLI

You can also verify your vault opt-out status using the Symbiotic CLI:

=== "MainNet"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py check-opt-in-vault INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS INSERT_VAULT_ADDRESS
    ```

=== "TestNet (Sepolia)"

    ```bash
    python3 symb.py check-opt-in-vault INSERT_OPERATOR_ADDRESS {{ networks.symbiotic.contracts.sepolia.vault }} --chain sepolia
    ```

The output will show `false` if you have successfully opted out of the vault and `true` if you are still opted in.

## Next Steps

After completing the offboarding process:

- Consider providing feedback about your experience to help improve the Tanssi network
- If you plan to return in the future, you can follow the [onboarding process](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/) again
