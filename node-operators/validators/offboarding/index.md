# Offboarding an Operator from the Tanssi Protocol

Stepping down as a validator requires following the proper procedures to ensure a smooth transition. This section provides clear instructions on properly offboarding your validator from the Tanssi network.

## Process Overview

The offboarding process consists of the following steps:

1. **Opt out from the Tanssi Network** (Required): This is the first and mandatory step to initiate the offboarding process and can be done via CLI, Etherscan, or Safe (for multisig setups)

2. **Contact Tanssi Team** (Required): Submit the offboarding form with the required information and wait for team acknowledgment

3. **Pause Operations** (Optional): Decommission your validator node after middleware removal confirmation

4. **Vault Opt out** (Optional): This step is optional and only necessary if you want to completely remove your association with the vault. Skipping this step won't affect your ability to rejoin the network in the future

!!! tip "Rejoining as a Validator"
    If you decide to return as a Tanssi validator in the future, you can easily onboard again by following the steps outlined in the [Onboarding](/node-operators/validators/onboarding/) guide.
