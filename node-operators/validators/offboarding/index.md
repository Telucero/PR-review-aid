# Offboarding

Stepping down as a validator requires following the proper procedures to ensure a smooth transition. This section provides clear instructions on properly offboarding your validator from the Tanssi network.

The offboarding process consists of the following steps:

1. Opt-out from the Tanssi network.
2. Contact the Tanssi team to initiate the offboarding process.
3. Wait for the team to remove your operator from the middleware
4. Pause your node operations
5. Opt-out from the vault (Optional)
