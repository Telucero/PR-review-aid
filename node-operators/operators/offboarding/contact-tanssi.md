# Contact Tanssi Team

Following the network opt out, the next stage of offboarding your Tanssi operator involves formally notifying the Tanssi team. This page guides you through submitting the required offboarding form and explaining what to expect during the final removal process.

After opting out from the network, notify the Tanssi team of your intention to stop running an operator to do so complete the [operator offboarding form](https://www.tanssi.network/ecosystem/operator-offboarding){target=_blank} and wait for confirmation of request completion from the Tanssi team.

Upon receiving your request, your operator's removal will be scheduled. This step is semi-automated and may take time to complete. You will be notified by email when it is safe to decommission the node. Please do not decommission your node until you receive this notification.

!!! important "Provide feedback"
    Consider providing feedback in the offboarding [form](https://www.tanssi.network/ecosystem/operator-offboarding){target=_blank} about your experience to help improve the Tanssi network.

## Pause Operations (Optional)

Once you receive confirmation of your operator's removal, you can safely stop any running services related to your operator. If needed, back up important configuration files, logs, or any relevant data before deleting them. Afterward, you may repurpose, terminate, or shut down your infrastructure entirely.
